# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

## This week challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. 
## A working Express.js API was provided and we were instructed to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## We also open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags to display the data in formatted JSON
## I also test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
